            <h1 class="margin text-center">SEP11- Project 2 : loops, object and APIS</h1>
            <p>Throughout my project 2, I demonstrate an understanding of loops, objects, and API. I got to learn how to pull data using API and contribute it to my project. In this project, I created a program with my groupmates Mera and Amia that allows user to type their input and give them the result of their input. In our program, you'll be asked to input what type of store you would like to visit in <i>Filton Street Mall<i>, and we will list out all the stores that fall into the user's input "store type" category. The project helps to filter out the API data to the user's input. </p>
            <p>We faced a few challenges when we are in the process of creating this project. At first, we have a little bit confuse about API and how it works.  Therefore, we take a bit while to figure out how to make the project work. We ended up resolving that problem when we start playing around. Our second challenge is how to debug the loops formatting through the given API. Although it is simple debugging, we are not satisfied with the way the data loops through. Initially, we only have a "for loop" that isn't specific enough to perform our result ``` for(var i = 0; i < data.length; i++){ ```, so we ended up having every store names and type listed out for the user instead of the type of store user inputted. It makes us use the "if loop" to helps us debug the loops more specifically. We use ``` if (data[i].type == usersStore) {``` to states that <b>if</b> the user's input store type (Ex: Food) match the store type in the data (Ex: Food), we would list out all the Food stores available in the data for the user to see. Our last challenge that our program will have an "UNDEFINED" appear next to the store that doesn't have a website. The "UNDEFINED" make users misunderstood the code because they would think the website URL is broken. We have trouble trying to change the word "UNDEFINED" to a blank space, but we ended up providing a notice that states that the "UNDEFINED" means there's no website available for the store. </p>
            <p> Our (my groupmate and I) next step is to learn how to make specific changes when we have an "UNDEFINED" for a particular area like the website I proposed before. I want to change the "UNDEFINED" to a blank space or state "THERE'S NO WEBSITE" when some stores didn't have a website link. Because the website in our program only prints out the website URL and the user has to copy and paste the URL. I wanted to make the website URL into a link so the user can press the link on the program, and it will directly bring them there to the store website. I also wanted to learn and incorporate CSS and HTML into my js program.  I want to change the fonts, add a background color, and have the text in the center of the program. I believe it is important to learn how to incorporate CSS and HTML in js because CSS and HTML play roles through the looks of the website. I want to have a clean and unique website presence instead of having a website/program with a boring default white background, and black text left aligns. Therefore, I would like to learn how to incorporate CSS and HTML into js (javascript) and learn about other js (javascript) knowledge to improve my project.</p>
